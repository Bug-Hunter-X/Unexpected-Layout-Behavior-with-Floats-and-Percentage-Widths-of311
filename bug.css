The following CSS rule is causing unexpected behavior:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This CSS rule attempts to make divs take up 50% of their parent container's width and float left.  However, this can lead to unexpected behavior if the parent container's width is not an even multiple of the div's width (50%). This can cause layout issues and unexpected wrapping.
