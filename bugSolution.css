The issue can be resolved by switching to flexbox.  Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Add this for accurate width calculation */
}
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap; /* Allow wrapping if needed */
}
```

Flexbox handles the distribution of space more reliably, regardless of whether the parent's width is evenly divisible.  Adding `box-sizing: border-box;` ensures the width is calculated correctly, including padding and border.
