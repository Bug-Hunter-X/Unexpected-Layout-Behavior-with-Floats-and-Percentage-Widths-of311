# Unexpected Layout Behavior with Floats and Percentage Widths

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to using `float: left` with percentage widths. When the parent container's width isn't evenly divisible by the child element's percentage width, unexpected wrapping or layout inconsistencies can occur.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS, and `bugSolution.css` offers a solution using flexbox.
